# Professional Experience

  - 2022 March-Present  
    **Internship (continuation) MetaAI London**
    
    During my internship at MetaAI I made a POC of a level building and
    editing tool for the MiniHack learning environment. I was invited
    back as a contractor to continue this work.

  - 2021 June-September  
    **Internship MetaAI London**
    
    For my internship with MetaAI, I worked on algorithms to improve
    training in IMPALA algorithm under data augmentation. I identified
    several problematic theoretical implications that negatively affect
    training and provided and evaluated methods to mitigate these
    effects. These methods centered around consistency regularization
    and geometric deep learning.

    **PhD - Artificial Intelligence in Gaming, Queen Mary University**
    
    My research interests are primarily in Deep Reinforcement leaning
    particularly using model-based planning as a method of improving
    sample efficiency and model accuracy. Model-based methods are a
    particuarly interesting area of research as they allow artificial
    agents to use tools which have psychological parallels such as
    imagination, curiosity and empowerment. I believe that these tools
    are a step towards general artificial intelligence.

    **Founder - embod.ai**
    
    embod.ai is a start-up where researchers, students and hobbiests can
    build and observe AI agents in Massively Multiplayer Online
    environments. The goal of embod.ai is to make AI based gaming and
    competitions a mainstream e-sport. Beta release:

    **EF10LDN Cohort Member - Entrepreneur First**
    
    Entrepreneur First is the UK’s most successful startup accellerator
    programme. Entrepreneur First gathers up to 100 highly talented
    individuals in two cohorts a year and helps them to build globally
    important companies.

    **Lead Research and Development engineer at import.io**
    
    import.io specializes in making it easy for non-technical users to
    gather and structure data from the web. I have worked at import.io
    since it was founded in 2012. I have worked mainly on designing and
    creating innovative technologies to generate a leading edge over any
    competitors. I have worked mainly in Java when building
    infrastructure and backend projects, and Python when doing Machine
    Learning.
    
    Some of the projects of which I have had significant input and I
    have enjoyed working on:
    
      - **Bees** - import.io’s highly distributed and scalable querying
        and messaging platform. Bees handles many challenges that are
        faced when building a distributed web extraction system, such as
        variable and unknown network latency, asynchronous IO across
        multiple servers and thousands of endpoints, pipelining and
        sorting of sparse data sets and collation of data from multiple
        sources.
    
      - **Label Suggestion** - A statistical model that would return the
        “most likely next label” that a user would chose for a data
        column given the previous data columns the user had inputted.
        Label suggestion used some highly optimized BLAS libraries to
        quickly infer probabilities over a large data set of manually
        labelled training data.
    
      - **Deep Learning** - Research projects with deep learning and web
        data extraction. For example I worked on several page
        classification approaches using Recurrent Neural networks and
        Recursive Neural networks. Additionally I worked on data point
        recognition where i worked to develop algorithms that would
        classify where there were datapoints in a webpage and then
        classify what label those data points should be given. The
        research was performed using a few different deep learning
        libraries; deeplearning4j, neon, keras (experimenting with
        tensorflow and theano).

  - 2012-2015  
    **Software Engineer at import.io**
    
    Before the machine learning and algorithm team was created at
    import.io, We were a small team of 3-5 engineers. At this time I
    mainly worked on the main Java codebase.

# Notable Projects

  - **Griddly**  
    Griddly is an open-source project aimed to be a all-encompassing
    platform for grid-world based research. Griddly provides a highly
    optimized game state and rendering engine with a flexible high-level
    interface for configuring environments. Not only does Griddly offer
    simple interfaces for single, multi-player and RTS games, but also
    multiple methods of rendering, configurable partial observability
    and interfaces for procedural content generation.

# Open Source Contributions

  - **Entity Neural Networks**  
    This is an ongoing project to provide implemenations and baselines
    for transformer models in reinforcement learning environments. More
    specifically the Griddly project natively provides interfaces for
    these types of models.

  - **RLLib**  
    Have made several contributions to RLLib, specifically around
    threading and memory usage in their implementation of the
    distributed IMPALA algorithm.

# Key Skills

  - C/C++  
    The majority of Griddly is written in C/C++ with bindings to Python,
    Julia and Javascript.

  - Python  
    I have worked with python in many different types of projects, from
    research with deep learning libraries such as pytorch and
    tensorflow, pytorch; To building REST API services using libraries
    such as Flask when productionizing machine learning models.

  - Java  
    The majority of my work at import.io was using Java. I have used
    Spring, SpringBoot, Hazelcast, Jedis, Jackson, Lettuce, Jetty 8/9,
    mockito, cucumber, gherkin and Google libraries such as Guava,
    Lombok and Futures.

  - Javascript/Typescript  
    I have mande several demos and smaller projects using React, such as
    simple level designers for Griddly and MiniHack learning
    environments.

  - Amazon AWS  
    I have used a large number of features of amazon aws while at
    import.io, embod.ai and in some personal projects. I am comfortable
    with using Lambda, CloudFormation, ECR, ECS, ElasticBeanstalk,
    Route53, S3, EC2, Redshift, AuroraDB and ElastiCache
